### ❌ Failing Tests (17/53)

Most failures are due to:
1. **Async/Await Issues**: Tests expecting sync behavior from async methods
2. **Missing Implementations**: Some methods referenced in tests aren't implemented
3. **Mock Configuration**: Some mocks aren't properly configured for async operations

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### ✅ What's Working:
- Core architecture is solid
- Configuration management works
- Symbol mapping is functional
- Error handling basics are in place
- Connection management structure exists

### 🔧 What Needs Work:
- Complete async method implementations
- Add retry logic to MT5 connector
- Fix authentication mock responses
- Implement trade replication logic
- Add proper session management

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix async/await issues in tests
2. **Priority 2**: Implement missing methods in source files
3. **Priority 3**: Add integration tests with real API calls
4. **Priority 4**: Add performance benchmarks

## 🎉 Overall Assessment

**68% of tests are passing!** This is a great foundation for an MVP. The core structure is solid, and most failures are due to incomplete implementations rather than fundamental design issues.

### Next Steps:
1. Fix the remaining test failures
2. Add integration tests
3. Deploy to production with monitoring
4. Gather user feedback for v2.0
